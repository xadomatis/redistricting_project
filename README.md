# redistricting_project
Evaluating fairness between the three (ish) congressional maps in the new millenium
This project has two steps:
First, I'm seeking to pull data on PVIs and election results from 2002 onward, to give a two decade basis for the predictive value of a PVI
This will inform a series of PVI based bins based on Probability
For instance, if an R+5 district is GOP held 75% of the time, then that PVI will be assigned a .75
Second, I plan to apply these metrics to the 2020 districts
This seeks to answer the question as to whether a congressional map adequatley represents a state's partisan lean
If it does not represent the state's lean, then we can determine by how much, and assign a value to the severity of the gerrymander
